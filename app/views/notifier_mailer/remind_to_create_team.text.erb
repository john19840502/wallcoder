Hey Friend,

Creating a team page on Coderwall has some great advantages.

Starting your team page is simple:
1. reserve a team name
2. add your company logo
3. invite your team members

Plus, here are a few things we'll do to make your new team page better.
* grab your member's pro tips and put them on your page
* scan your member's profile to populate your skills
* assign your team a score to rank against others
* beautifully display all of your members

Voil√†! You'll have a awesome page like Github and many others.
