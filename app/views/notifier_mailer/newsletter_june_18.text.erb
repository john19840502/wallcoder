We just released a new coderwall designed from the ground up to be the best way to summarize your achievements and expertise. We hope you find the new coderwall a space for tech's most talented makers to connect, share, build and be inspired.

We also added pro tips so you can easily share and save interesting links, code, and ideas. We make it super easy to find pro tips you've previously shared or upvoted. Check out the trending pro tips or create your own:

To help us launch coderwall's new pro tip feature, we asked some of the awesome developers in the coderwall community to share an exclusive view of their workspace. Since we spend most of our time at desks in front of computers, the right setup is crucial for our best hacking. Hopefully you will find these as inspirational as we did: https://coderwall.com/p/gxjpna
