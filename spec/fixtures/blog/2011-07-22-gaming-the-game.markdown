We are putting together a page listing all the hacks & utilities that others have created for coderwall or with the coderwall api. Much to our surprise, a quick search on github for 'coderwall' came across this:

![Cheater!](/images/cheeter.png)

We had a good laugh at the description but seriously no gaming the system. In reality, this cheat would never work because we do some basic analysis on repos to see if they are "worthy" and this one is clearly not. It is a rather simplistic check today but we are constantly making the system more sophisticated for future achievements.
More importantly we will be rolling out a new feature soon where you'll be able to explore which repos earned someone a specific achievement. We think this is a great way to showcase interesting open source projects and provide more context to your profile. 

Be forewarned then that if you decide to create some cheat repos, they will be prominently showcased on your profile along with a way for users to flag them. :)

happy coding!
